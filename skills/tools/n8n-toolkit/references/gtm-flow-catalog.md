## Inbound Flows

  → HTTP: LeadMagic company enrich (by domain)
  → Code: ICP score (employee_count, industry, geo, title)
  → Switch icp_score:
      branch A (≥70): sw-crm-upsert-contact → round-robin owner → Slack #hot-leads
      branch B (40-69): CRM upsert → list=nurture → tag inbound-nurture
      branch C (<40): log to Sheet disqualified + reason → STOP
